My name is Brandon Martinez. I am a Junior majoring in Computer Science in the College.
I'm from San Antonio, Texas but was born in San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato, Mexico. 
I haven't been there in a couple of years but it's a really beautiful Spanish Colonial town
that's huge for American tourism.
I'm a big hip hop fan, I play a lot of basketball, and work as a Supervisor for the Intramurals
Department here at Columbia.
